# Heetch front-end candidate challenge

## Prerequisites

As a Frontend engineer at Heetch you will touch multiple sides of the business building both customer facing and internal based web applications.

Almost all of our services are permission based, meaning that as an engineer you have to always be mindful of adhering to the security and permission logic that control a service.

## Your task

Create a single page web application with a multi level navigation. This navigation will form the foundation of the web app. The contents of the navigation will be populated dynamically from hitting a `permissions` web service. More details are described below.

### Timeline

The task usually takes around 15-20 hours in total to be completed. Obviously you'll do it in chunks. We'd however ideally receive your solution within a week. It's also ok if you need a little more time. Just let us know.

### Stack

- **React** is our most common framework of choice, thus it would be a preferred tool to use for this implementation.
- Any other tools/components are absolutely of your choice.

### Code of conduct

- Create a new branch, commit and push to this branch.
- Include a detailed `README.md`. Explain how to run the tests and start the app.
- Submit a pull request once you are done.
- Provide a detailed overview when creating your PR explaining any technical choices you have made.
- **If you come across any blocker while developing this application, feel free to open an issue within this repo at any time, and our developers will be on their way to help you.**
- If you have any suggestions on how we could improve the challenge, don't hesitate to include that in the PR description as well! We value creativity and new ideas.

### Product requirements

1. Implement a multi level navigation (this means that each element is either link to a route or expands another, deeper level of the navigation)
2. The content of the navigation should be populated from the `permissions` endpoint

- Top level menu items are being built based on `keys` of JSON object returned from `permissions`
- Sub items are held in `children` property of the object

3. Items in the navigation should be ordered by `order` attribute in item object
4. Name of the  item is taken from the object key, e.g.:

```
...
products: {
    order: 1,
    actions: {
...
```

creates `Products` menu item.

5. Implement possibility of listing all cities per country and all products, taking into consideration the permissions
6. Implement possibility of adding, editing and saving the country and product
7. Each of the navigation items and route permissions are determined by each blocks `actions` object. If the `action` value is missing consider it `false`
8. Your application should implement 3 routes:

- `/`

  - The root page of the application and will be the starting point of the app

- `/products`

  - Display a list of products.
  - Ability to update an existing product from the list.
  - Ability to add a new product

- `/cities`
  - Display a list of Cities.
  - Ability to update an existing city from the list.
  - Ability to add a new city

### What will we assess

- Fulfilling all requirements
- App functionality
- Your knowledge on using React and JavaScript
- Code cleanliness
- How you approach app architecture
- How you ensure your app stability
- Documentation
- Design itself will not be a deciding factor on this test, and you will not be judged on design.

Due to time limitation we don't expect flawless or production-ready code. Just do your best under the given constrains.

## API
- [`/permissions`](apiDoc/permissions.md)
- [`/cities`](apiDoc/cities.md)
- [`/products`](apiDoc/products.md)
- [Errors](apiDoc/errors.md)

## Bonus

1. Demonstrate or describe clear ways in which you would improve the UX
2. Make the UI great!

**That's it ðŸ˜€ We wish you well in the above challenge, and we look forward to reviewing your PR ðŸš€**
